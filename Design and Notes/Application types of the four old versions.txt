Investigating Application Types of four old versions
None of the old .csproj's can be opened in Visual Studio 2017 or 2019

Not sure if I ever got all of these running. Original definately ran on Win8 but eventually had issues.

GS: Original version targeting Windows 8
    <OutputType>AppContainerExe</OutputType>

	
GS81: Windows 8.1
    <OutputType>AppContainerExe</OutputType>
    <TargetPlatformVersion>8.1</TargetPlatformVersion>
	
GS-Mercury (Combined Win8.1/Win Phone 8.1):
"Apps for Windows Phone 8.1 can now be created using the same application model as Windows Store apps for Windows 8.1, based on the Windows Runtime, and the file extension for WP apps is now ".appx" (which is used for Windows Store apps), instead of Windows Phone's traditional ".xap" file format."
    <OutputType>AppContainerExe</OutputType>
	
GS10: (UWP for Windows 10)
    <OutputType>AppContainerExe</OutputType>
    <TargetPlatformIdentifier>UAP</TargetPlatformIdentifier>
    <TargetPlatformVersion>10.0.17763.0</TargetPlatformVersion>
    <TargetPlatformMinVersion>10.0.17763.0</TargetPlatformMinVersion>
